# OOD Experiments Dataset Eenerators

This repository contains the scripts used for generating out-of-distribution datasets used in my PhD thesis: *Out-of-distribution generalisation in machine learning*.
The datasets are variants of SortOfCLEVR, NotSoCLEVR and a problem of classifying images containing multiple digits sampled from the MNIST dataset.
